# Dogs vs Cats Classification with Xception

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using the Xception model. Xception is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that has shown strong performance in image classification tasks.

The model is deployed on Hugging Face for easy access and integration into your projects. You can find the deployed model [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/moazx/Dogs-vs-Cats-classification-with-Xception).
